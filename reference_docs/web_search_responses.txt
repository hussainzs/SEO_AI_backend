Penn Board of Trustees Votes to Appoint J. Larry Jameson President and Extend His Term Through June 2027 March 13, 2025 The Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania today voted unanimously to appoint J. Larry Jameson, who has served as Interim President since December 2023, President of the University for a term that will run through June 30, 2027. An update to the University community on recent executive orders February 24, 2025 I know our community is closely following the flurry of recent executive orders, federal guidance, and legal actions, especially as they affect higher education, diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, research programs, funding, and immigration. Penn has always upheld the law, and we will continue doing so. But the future of higher education may alter dramatically depending on how courts rule, how agencies implement new policies, and how future orders and legislation are enacted.']

Highlights: ['Last week, we learned through various news outlets that the Trump Administration was expected to suspend $175M in federal contracts awarded to Penn, citing the participation of a transgender athlete on the women’s swimming team in 2022. Previously, on February 6, 2025, the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) notified Penn that it had initiated a directed investigation under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal statute prohibiting sex discrimination, into the University’s intercollegiate athletics participation policies. For NCAA Division I sports, eligibility is governed by NCAA rules. Beginning in 2010, the NCAA required that transgender student-athletes be permitted to participate on college teams. Penn has never had a transgender student-athlete policy of its own.']

Highlights: ['Let us know!   Earlier this month, the Trump administration abruptly terminated the student status of more than 1,000 international students around the country, including at the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University and Rutgers University. But now the government has reversed itself and restored status for some, including three at the University of Pennsylvania, as confirmed by a university spokesperson.  There are more than 1 million international students in the U.S., and the government went after a small group of them. Lawyers say what these cases had in common is that the students had some minor run-ins with the law, which they say are the equivalent of traffic tickets and have never had any bearing on student status.']

Highlights: ["The NCAA changed its policy the day after Trump signed an executive order on Feb. 5 that was intended to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls and women's sports. That ended its sport-by-sport practice in favor of a blanket policy that only allows athletes assigned female at birth to participate in women's sports. The Education Department also opened reviews of San Jose State University volleyball, Denver Public Schools, Portland Public Schools, Oregon School Activities Association and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association. It also sued the state of Maine to force it to ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports or face prosecution. "]
