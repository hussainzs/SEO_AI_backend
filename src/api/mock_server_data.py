These sources offer detailed legal, political, and social context, including the Department of Homeland Security's rationale, the impact on Harvard's student body and finances, and judicial interventions blocking the administration's actions. Their strengths lie in timely reporting, depth of investigation, and inclusion of multiple perspectives, including university officials, students, and government representatives. However, these competitors focus heavily on Harvard, with limited coverage of Penn's stance or actions, representing a content gap.\n\nOur article uniquely highlights the University of Pennsylvania's response and support for international students, filling a critical niche not extensively covered by competitors. To dominate the topic, we should expand on Penn's initiatives, legal support, and community impact, leveraging the large international student population at Penn as a differentiator. Additionally, integrating detailed analysis of the federal policies' implications on both institutions and offering actionable guidance for international students could enhance our content's authority and relevance. Addressing the emotional and legal challenges faced by students, as well as institutional responses, will position our article as a comprehensive resource, capitalizing on competitors' focus gaps and reinforcing our SEO strength in this niche.",
