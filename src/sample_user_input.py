Ivy League institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania, are witnessing widespread student and faculty protests against recent and proposed cuts to National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. These demonstrations highlight deep concerns about the future of critical research, academic freedom, and the very fabric of higher education.

At UPenn, hundreds of students, faculty, and staff have gathered to voice their outrage. As reported by CBS Philadelphia in March 2025, a significant portion of federal funding, including an estimated $175 million for UPenn alone, has been frozen or cut. Protesters are demanding that the university guarantee continued funding for vital research, particularly in the wake of these federal actions. Penn's American Association of University Professors (AAUP-Penn) has been instrumental in organizing these rallies, emphasizing the threat to "higher education for the public good."

The impact extends beyond immediate financial losses. Faculty members express fear for the future of research careers, and graduate admissions have reportedly been affected, with some institutions even rescinding acceptance offers. The cuts to indirect costs, which support essential lab infrastructure, equipment, and administrative staff, are proving particularly damaging. As reported by The Daily Pennsylvanian in March, Penn professors and students have participated in "Stand Up for Science" rallies, underscoring that NIH funding is an investment in the entire community, not just scientists.


Harvard University has been hit particularly hard, with reports from AP News and Al Jazeera detailing over $2.6 billion in federal grant cuts and freezes, attributed by the Trump administration to the university's handling of campus protests and other policy disagreements. In response, Harvard has committed $250 million of its own funds as a temporary measure, while also pursuing legal action against the administration. Yale, though largely spared from targeted cuts, has also seen a significant drop in NIH funding, according to the Yale Daily News.


These protests underscore a broader national concern among academic and scientific communities: that federal funding for research is being weaponized for political leverage, jeopardizing groundbreaking discoveries and the training of the next generation of scientists. Universities are bracing for what they anticipate will be a "severe" impact, with hiring freezes and cost-saving measures becoming increasingly common as they navigate this uncertain landscape.

College Grads Grapple with a Shaky Job Market and AI Uncertainty

As the Class of 2025 steps into the workforce, many are finding the path bumpier than expected. The job market, once buzzing with opportunity, has tightened, with unemployment among recent grads climbing to 5.8% this March—up from 4.6% a year ago. And while many students once looked to the federal government for entry-level opportunities, a wave of executive orders earlier this year caused a noticeable slowdown in hiring.

On top of this, fears around artificial intelligence are shaking graduates' confidence. A recent Handshake survey found that 62% of students are concerned about AI’s impact on their future careers—a sharp rise from 44% just two years ago. Humanities and computer science majors, surprisingly, are among the most anxious.

Even those who do land jobs are often underwhelmed by the pay. A ZipRecruiter report showed that recent grads expected salaries north of $100,000, but most are starting closer to $68,000. Disappointment is high, and some feel misled.

While the outlook isn’t all doom and gloom—many companies still plan to promote and offer raises—the message is clear: today’s grads need to stay flexible, realistic, and ready to adapt in a workforce that’s evolving fast.

Judge orders Penn Professor Michael Mann to pay over $477,000 in fees from defamation case:

A District of Columbia judge ordered Presidential Distinguished Professor of Earth and Environmental Science Michael Mann to pay additional legal fees to his opponents in a defamation case, further unraveling his victory from last year.

After winning his defamation case against bloggers Rand Simberg and Mark Steyn last year, Mann — Penn’s vice provost for climate science, policy, and action — has been ordered to pay attorneys’ fees totaling $477,350.80 based on the dismissal of three of his claims in 2019. The defendants filed the motion for fees under D.C.’s Anti-SLAPP Act, which is intended to protect those exercising free speech from frivolous defamation lawsuits. 

“My lawyers and I believe that yesterday’s fee award entered by the trial court was not correctly decided, and we intend to seek further review of that award,” Mann wrote in a statement to The Daily Pennsylvanian. “In the meantime, we also are pursuing an appeal from the trial court’s earlier ruling reducing the punitive damages awarded to me by the jury and other errors.”

The May 22 decision marks yet another shift in Mann’s initial victory in his February 2024 defamation case, in which he was awarded more than $1 million in damages against Simberg, a former adjunct fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and Steyn, a contributor to the National Review. Mann alleged that Simberg and Steyn had defamed him in a series of blog posts discrediting his climate change research in 2012.

In his most recent opinion, D.C. Superior Court Judge Alfred S. Irving, Jr. wrote that “CEI and Mr. Simberg were successful on the appeal of their anti-SLAPP motion and any other conclusion would be untenable under the terms of the statute and the Court of Appeals’ construction of the statute.”

As a result, Irving found that CEI and Simberg were “presumptively entitled to attorneys’ fees.” Irving’s decision followed a January ruling that ordered Mann to pay $530,000 to the National Review based on the same statute. 

In March, Irving sanctioned Mann and his legal team for providing misleading and inconsistent information during the trial. Irving called disparities in the case “an affront to the Court’s authority” and referred to the “bad-faith trial misconduct” of Mann and his legal team. He also threw out the earlier penalty owed by Steyn and reduced the damages to $5,000, stating that the verdict against Steyn was “grossly excessive.”

Mann's legal team presented a chart listing a grant that Mann allegedly lost due to the defamatory remarks as $9.7 million. However, in a separate testimony, Mann stated the grant was worth $112,000. Comparing Mann’s grant income before and after the accusations from Simberg and Steyn, Mann's lawyers initially claimed a disparity of $2.8 million, while a corrected calculation put the difference at $2.37 million.

"I am pleased the court upheld the jury’s verdict on the hockey stick graph, the defamatory statements, and the injury to my good name," Mann posted on his X account following the issuing of the sanctions. "I am confident neither I nor my lawyers did anything wrong during the trial."

Mann’s X account has amassed more than 200,000 followers, and he has been referred to by NPR as a figure “among the world's most renowned climate scientists.” Mann is also the director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability, and the Media. Before beginning his position at Penn in 2022, Mann taught at Penn State for 17 years.

Speaker Mike Johnson is urging Senate Republicans not to greatly alter the sweeping spending and tax cuts bill that the House GOP managed to advance in a laborious back-and-forth process last week.

There are early signs that some Republican senators will not heed that call.

President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” — aimed at advancing much of his domestic policy agenda in a single package — hangs in the balance.

Here’s where things stand:

Johnson’s pitch: The House speaker told CNN’s Jake Tapper today that if senators make too many changes to the bill his chamber advanced, he may not be able to pass it back through the House and send it to Trump’s desk.

“I have a very delicate balance here, very delicate equilibrium that we’ve reached over a long period of time, and it’s best not to meddle with it too much,” Johnson said.

The speaker claimed scores of the bill predicting it will increase the national debt — a key GOP sticking point — are “dramatically overstated.”

GOP critics: Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has emerged as a key skeptic. The Wisconsin lawmaker told CNN he believes there’s enough GOP resistance to halt Trump’s bill in the Senate if major changes aren’t made to the legislation.

The senator is pushing for deeper spending cuts, arguing this is Congress’ “only chance” to reset to a “reasonable, pre-pandemic level of spending.”

Republican Sen. Rand Paul, a leading deficit hawk, said on “Fox News Sunday” that he will not vote for the legislation unless a debt ceiling increase is removed, calling the bill’s spending cuts “wimpy and anemic.”

And other critics, including Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Josh Hawley of Missouri, have cited concerns about the bill’s changes to Medicaid and tax credit levels.

Democrats pile on: Lacking a majority in either chamber, Democrats have focused on highlighting the perceived winners and losers of the bill in its current form. Analysts say millions of low-income Americans stand to lose benefits, while the wealthy would see most of the windfall from tax cuts.
