Ivy League institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania, are witnessing widespread student and faculty protests against recent and proposed cuts to National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. These demonstrations highlight deep concerns about the future of critical research, academic freedom, and the very fabric of higher education.

At UPenn, hundreds of students, faculty, and staff have gathered to voice their outrage. As reported by CBS Philadelphia in March 2025, a significant portion of federal funding, including an estimated $175 million for UPenn alone, has been frozen or cut. Protesters are demanding that the university guarantee continued funding for vital research, particularly in the wake of these federal actions. Penn's American Association of University Professors (AAUP-Penn) has been instrumental in organizing these rallies, emphasizing the threat to "higher education for the public good."

The impact extends beyond immediate financial losses. Faculty members express fear for the future of research careers, and graduate admissions have reportedly been affected, with some institutions even rescinding acceptance offers. The cuts to indirect costs, which support essential lab infrastructure, equipment, and administrative staff, are proving particularly damaging. As reported by The Daily Pennsylvanian in March, Penn professors and students have participated in "Stand Up for Science" rallies, underscoring that NIH funding is an investment in the entire community, not just scientists.


Harvard University has been hit particularly hard, with reports from AP News and Al Jazeera detailing over $2.6 billion in federal grant cuts and freezes, attributed by the Trump administration to the university's handling of campus protests and other policy disagreements. In response, Harvard has committed $250 million of its own funds as a temporary measure, while also pursuing legal action against the administration. Yale, though largely spared from targeted cuts, has also seen a significant drop in NIH funding, according to the Yale Daily News.


These protests underscore a broader national concern among academic and scientific communities: that federal funding for research is being weaponized for political leverage, jeopardizing groundbreaking discoveries and the training of the next generation of scientists. Universities are bracing for what they anticipate will be a "severe" impact, with hiring freezes and cost-saving measures becoming increasingly common as they navigate this uncertain landscape.

College Grads Grapple with a Shaky Job Market and AI Uncertainty

As the Class of 2025 steps into the workforce, many are finding the path bumpier than expected. The job market, once buzzing with opportunity, has tightened, with unemployment among recent grads climbing to 5.8% this March—up from 4.6% a year ago. And while many students once looked to the federal government for entry-level opportunities, a wave of executive orders earlier this year caused a noticeable slowdown in hiring.

On top of this, fears around artificial intelligence are shaking graduates' confidence. A recent Handshake survey found that 62% of students are concerned about AI’s impact on their future careers—a sharp rise from 44% just two years ago. Humanities and computer science majors, surprisingly, are among the most anxious.

Even those who do land jobs are often underwhelmed by the pay. A ZipRecruiter report showed that recent grads expected salaries north of $100,000, but most are starting closer to $68,000. Disappointment is high, and some feel misled.

While the outlook isn’t all doom and gloom—many companies still plan to promote and offer raises—the message is clear: today’s grads need to stay flexible, realistic, and ready to adapt in a workforce that’s evolving fast.

Judge orders Penn Professor Michael Mann to pay over $477,000 in fees from defamation case:

A District of Columbia judge ordered Presidential Distinguished Professor of Earth and Environmental Science Michael Mann to pay additional legal fees to his opponents in a defamation case, further unraveling his victory from last year.

After winning his defamation case against bloggers Rand Simberg and Mark Steyn last year, Mann — Penn’s vice provost for climate science, policy, and action — has been ordered to pay attorneys’ fees totaling $477,350.80 based on the dismissal of three of his claims in 2019. The defendants filed the motion for fees under D.C.’s Anti-SLAPP Act, which is intended to protect those exercising free speech from frivolous defamation lawsuits. 

“My lawyers and I believe that yesterday’s fee award entered by the trial court was not correctly decided, and we intend to seek further review of that award,” Mann wrote in a statement to The Daily Pennsylvanian. “In the meantime, we also are pursuing an appeal from the trial court’s earlier ruling reducing the punitive damages awarded to me by the jury and other errors.”

The May 22 decision marks yet another shift in Mann’s initial victory in his February 2024 defamation case, in which he was awarded more than $1 million in damages against Simberg, a former adjunct fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and Steyn, a contributor to the National Review. Mann alleged that Simberg and Steyn had defamed him in a series of blog posts discrediting his climate change research in 2012.

In his most recent opinion, D.C. Superior Court Judge Alfred S. Irving, Jr. wrote that “CEI and Mr. Simberg were successful on the appeal of their anti-SLAPP motion and any other conclusion would be untenable under the terms of the statute and the Court of Appeals’ construction of the statute.”

As a result, Irving found that CEI and Simberg were “presumptively entitled to attorneys’ fees.” Irving’s decision followed a January ruling that ordered Mann to pay $530,000 to the National Review based on the same statute. 

In March, Irving sanctioned Mann and his legal team for providing misleading and inconsistent information during the trial. Irving called disparities in the case “an affront to the Court’s authority” and referred to the “bad-faith trial misconduct” of Mann and his legal team. He also threw out the earlier penalty owed by Steyn and reduced the damages to $5,000, stating that the verdict against Steyn was “grossly excessive.”

Mann's legal team presented a chart listing a grant that Mann allegedly lost due to the defamatory remarks as $9.7 million. However, in a separate testimony, Mann stated the grant was worth $112,000. Comparing Mann’s grant income before and after the accusations from Simberg and Steyn, Mann's lawyers initially claimed a disparity of $2.8 million, while a corrected calculation put the difference at $2.37 million.

"I am pleased the court upheld the jury’s verdict on the hockey stick graph, the defamatory statements, and the injury to my good name," Mann posted on his X account following the issuing of the sanctions. "I am confident neither I nor my lawyers did anything wrong during the trial."

Mann’s X account has amassed more than 200,000 followers, and he has been referred to by NPR as a figure “among the world's most renowned climate scientists.” Mann is also the director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability, and the Media. Before beginning his position at Penn in 2022, Mann taught at Penn State for 17 years.

Speaker Mike Johnson is urging Senate Republicans not to greatly alter the sweeping spending and tax cuts bill that the House GOP managed to advance in a laborious back-and-forth process last week.

There are early signs that some Republican senators will not heed that call.

President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” — aimed at advancing much of his domestic policy agenda in a single package — hangs in the balance.

Here’s where things stand:

Johnson’s pitch: The House speaker told CNN’s Jake Tapper today that if senators make too many changes to the bill his chamber advanced, he may not be able to pass it back through the House and send it to Trump’s desk.

“I have a very delicate balance here, very delicate equilibrium that we’ve reached over a long period of time, and it’s best not to meddle with it too much,” Johnson said.

The speaker claimed scores of the bill predicting it will increase the national debt — a key GOP sticking point — are “dramatically overstated.”

GOP critics: Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has emerged as a key skeptic. The Wisconsin lawmaker told CNN he believes there’s enough GOP resistance to halt Trump’s bill in the Senate if major changes aren’t made to the legislation.

The senator is pushing for deeper spending cuts, arguing this is Congress’ “only chance” to reset to a “reasonable, pre-pandemic level of spending.”

Republican Sen. Rand Paul, a leading deficit hawk, said on “Fox News Sunday” that he will not vote for the legislation unless a debt ceiling increase is removed, calling the bill’s spending cuts “wimpy and anemic.”

And other critics, including Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Josh Hawley of Missouri, have cited concerns about the bill’s changes to Medicaid and tax credit levels.

Democrats pile on: Lacking a majority in either chamber, Democrats have focused on highlighting the perceived winners and losers of the bill in its current form. Analysts say millions of low-income Americans stand to lose benefits, while the wealthy would see most of the windfall from tax cuts.

My Husband And I Assumed We Would Have Kids. A Dog Changed Our Minds.

My husband, Nate, and I used to assume we’d have kids. We were both from the Ozarks and married young — plenty of time. But as our friends began to replace papasans and beer bongs with bouncy swings, we instead moved to New York City and later New Orleans (and then back to New York City). We got our first passports. I got a staff job at a magazine and found my career to be exhilarating.

As we grew up together, we fell more in love, but the desire for children never arrived.

By the time we had been married for 11 years, I was 35 years old and Nate was 37 — the age range my friends were dubbing the “closing door moment.” We knew we should make a final decision about what our family would look like. Did I need to freeze my eggs? Did I even have eggs? How would children fit into the life of a travel writer? Did we want children at all?

While many people I knew were catching baby fever, I ached for a dog, and found myself covertly snapping photos of strangers’ pets on the street. Once, during a cocktail party, I told a fellow guest that I’d prefer to give birth to a puppy. No one wants to hear that confession. People instead want to hear that you love the smell of babies. But that wasn’t our life … not yet, anyway.

A dog, however, was a no-brainer. We already had a cat we called Kitty Fat Pants: a portly feline who showed up on a neighbor’s doorstep while they were making a meatloaf. For me, having animals was natural; I grew up in a houseful of them. We had cats, dogs, birds, a ferret and even a miniature pig named Mabel.

Nate and I met our dog in Louisiana, a 4-year-old-ish black rescue Lab-shepherd mix we named Delta Burke. It was an homage to the raven-haired diva from “Designing Women,” one of my favorite sitcoms as a child. Our Delta’s coat was the same glossy black and she was born in the South but had little else in common with the star.

Instead of Suzanne Sugarbaker sass, our Delta whimpered and cried constantly for her first few months at our house, allowing us little sleep coupled with an excruciating amount of worry. She was a trepidatious eater, afraid to walk through doorways and did not want to be cuddled. I’ve heard many mothers murmur the mantra that the days are long but the years are short, and it rang true to me. I wasn’t a mother struggling through overnights with an infant, but making sure this animal felt at home became my most important task.

It wasn’t long before Delta slowly started to turn a corner. She learned that we were her protectors. She soon took to greeting me at my bedside each morning and liked to nuzzle her nose near my chest. Her age didn’t matter yet.

It was ours that did. Our door was starting to close.

Delta fit perfectly into our little family. She became calm over the years. She seemed happy. As she creeped up in age, my husband and I often discussed how distraught we’d be when she was no longer with us. I’m a type-A planner and was prepared to be unmoored by the grieving period. I once told Nate to lock me in a padded room with a sedative after she left us.

Grief was not foreign to either of us. While we were in our early 20s, my husband saw his father die of a heart attack while watching the MLB All-Star game. Three years later, I found my own father dead, pills scattered on his bedside table. But those were humans, parents. We expected it to feel different when our pets passed on.

Most of my childhood animals died of old age, were occasionally run over by vehicles or scampered away into the woods forever. We weren’t the type of family who had our animals’ teeth cleaned or sent off for a doggie DNA kit — let alone take them to the vet to be peacefully euthanized.

Kitty Fat Pants, Delta’s sister, lived to be about 15 years old, and while I knew it was getting close to her life’s end, our final visit to the vet concluded with our veterinarian telling us that it was indeed “time.” Our Kitty had an inoperative tumor. This would be my first experience with euthanasia. I grief-panicked, and the conversation went something like this:

Vet: Would you like to have Kitty cremated and keep the ashes?

Me: No, but I would like you to cut off her paw and give it to me before I leave.

Vet: Pardon?

Me: (Incredulous): I want one of her paws. I’m open to any of the four, but I want to take one home and put it on a keychain.

Vet: Like the rabbit keychains from the ’80s? We don’t do that. Do you want her ashes instead?

I did not.

When we returned home from the vet, Delta Burke gave us her typical greeting; the type that makes a person feel like the most important human to ever have lived and breathed. You’d have thought Beyoncé walked through our front door. Losing Kitty Fat Pants was devastating. But there was no more reliable comfort than Delta spilling her love all over us.

Delta had lived in New Orleans, Northern California and New York City. She had put her paws in the Atlantic and Pacific. She even stayed at The Plaza Hotel and was given a custom bath robe. We were the couple who treated our dog like the child we never had — and learned that we never wanted.

We called Delta our doghter. We also called her Nubby for her nub tail. We called her Deltini, as in, “Deltini, do you want a martini? Or perhaps a peach bellini?” But the most appropriate nickname for Delta was Mrs. Velvet Ears, another riff on a comedy from the ’80s. I’d spend hours stroking those soft fur triangles and would then whisper into them how much I adored her.

By the time we reached out early 40s, we’d been married for 21 years, and had come to a very satisfying decision: Nate would get a vasectomy. (Snip snip! Bag of frozen peas! Voila!)

When our vet told us that Delta wouldn’t have much time left, we planned a road trip — one of her favorite activities. She loved the car, her head perched out the rolled-down window, tongue flapping in the wind. We were on our way to Oklahoma City, where my husband, Nate, would be on assignment for three months, and had rented an Airbnb with a large backyard for her to roam. Her last year was to be a celebration.

But Delta’s time with us turned out to be much shorter.

The previous month had been a flurry of at-home vet visits, trying to determine why our girl had no appetite and took to hiding under the bed. Her sight had deteriorated, but we were sure that once she got a whiff of that rich red dirt in Oklahoma, she’d be zooming around the lawn.

On the drive out, we stopped in our hometown in the Ozarks and were surrounded by our entire family while Delta lay with labored breath in front of the fireplace. The next morning, we knew.

After scrambling to find a vet, we secured an appointment within two hours time. Her appointment for death was set for 10:30 a.m. She was then 14 years old by the LSPCA’s estimate.

It’s utterly bizarre to know exactly how much time you have left with your beloved pet. The kind stranger who would serve as Delta’s death vet gave us five minutes to say goodbye. The time was agonizing but allowed us to hug her. It gave us time to tell our Deltini that we loved her. Time to whisper in the velvet triangles on her head.

As my husband and I sobbed into her fur, I asked him, “Do you think this vet would let us have one of her ears?” Instead, we snipped off a tuft of her soft black hair and placed it in a Ziplock baggie.

Right now is the first time my husband and I have ever lived without an animal in our home. That Airbnb in Oklahoma is void of dog hair and lazy snoring. I’ve not had the heart to sit in the backyard. We recently went to the local Walmart and I cried fat tears as we passed Pup-Peroni and dog decor, emblazoned with a snappy quote and a paw print. I would have scoffed at those signs in the past, but someday we’ll get another dog, and perhaps I’ll hang one next to the toothbrush holder.

But not yet. Right now, we’re navigating life as temporary empty-nesters, unmoored by grief and trading trigger warnings when we pass a black dog in the park or find a wisp of her fur in our sneakers.

We adopted Delta during the throes of our child-bearing years, and she rescued us from a life that we didn’t want. Our Doghter Delta slipped right in that “closing door” and gave us the blueprint for a future. Our lifetimes are to write a novel, but with a dog, we get only a few chapters. Delta taught us that it was enough.

We are enough.
