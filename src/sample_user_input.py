Ivy League institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania, are witnessing widespread student and faculty protests against recent and proposed cuts to National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. These demonstrations highlight deep concerns about the future of critical research, academic freedom, and the very fabric of higher education.

At UPenn, hundreds of students, faculty, and staff have gathered to voice their outrage. As reported by CBS Philadelphia in March 2025, a significant portion of federal funding, including an estimated $175 million for UPenn alone, has been frozen or cut. Protesters are demanding that the university guarantee continued funding for vital research, particularly in the wake of these federal actions. Penn's American Association of University Professors (AAUP-Penn) has been instrumental in organizing these rallies, emphasizing the threat to "higher education for the public good."

The impact extends beyond immediate financial losses. Faculty members express fear for the future of research careers, and graduate admissions have reportedly been affected, with some institutions even rescinding acceptance offers. The cuts to indirect costs, which support essential lab infrastructure, equipment, and administrative staff, are proving particularly damaging. As reported by The Daily Pennsylvanian in March, Penn professors and students have participated in "Stand Up for Science" rallies, underscoring that NIH funding is an investment in the entire community, not just scientists.


Harvard University has been hit particularly hard, with reports from AP News and Al Jazeera detailing over $2.6 billion in federal grant cuts and freezes, attributed by the Trump administration to the university's handling of campus protests and other policy disagreements. In response, Harvard has committed $250 million of its own funds as a temporary measure, while also pursuing legal action against the administration. Yale, though largely spared from targeted cuts, has also seen a significant drop in NIH funding, according to the Yale Daily News.


These protests underscore a broader national concern among academic and scientific communities: that federal funding for research is being weaponized for political leverage, jeopardizing groundbreaking discoveries and the training of the next generation of scientists. Universities are bracing for what they anticipate will be a "severe" impact, with hiring freezes and cost-saving measures becoming increasingly common as they navigate this uncertain landscape.

College Grads Grapple with a Shaky Job Market and AI Uncertainty

As the Class of 2025 steps into the workforce, many are finding the path bumpier than expected. The job market, once buzzing with opportunity, has tightened, with unemployment among recent grads climbing to 5.8% this March—up from 4.6% a year ago. And while many students once looked to the federal government for entry-level opportunities, a wave of executive orders earlier this year caused a noticeable slowdown in hiring.

On top of this, fears around artificial intelligence are shaking graduates' confidence. A recent Handshake survey found that 62% of students are concerned about AI’s impact on their future careers—a sharp rise from 44% just two years ago. Humanities and computer science majors, surprisingly, are among the most anxious.

Even those who do land jobs are often underwhelmed by the pay. A ZipRecruiter report showed that recent grads expected salaries north of $100,000, but most are starting closer to $68,000. Disappointment is high, and some feel misled.

While the outlook isn’t all doom and gloom—many companies still plan to promote and offer raises—the message is clear: today’s grads need to stay flexible, realistic, and ready to adapt in a workforce that’s evolving fast.
